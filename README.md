(required documentation in jupyter notebook file attached)

1: A custom made ResNet13 model for Caltech-UCSD-Birds-200-2011 dataset. (Image classification (Beta))

2: Using a ResNet model on a simple MNIST dataset to check models efficiency and power on simple dataset (gives 98% accuracy in a single epoch)

3: inaturalist12k dataset on a custom ResNet"14" model.Gives an increase 10% accuracy after a 5hr train (subject to GPU speed).Could be improved by using other models like Inception ResNet etc. Also box annoatotation around the objects can help in increasing the accuracy more.

4: MNIST GANs which generates a random number images from range 0-9 given a random input vector.The pertrained parameters for the generator and discriminator model  (trained upto 300 epochs) have also been attached.
