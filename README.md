# Deep-Learning
(required documentation in jupyter notebook file attached)

1: A custom made ResNet13 model for Caltech-UCSD-Birds-200-2011 dataset. (Image classification (Beta))
2: Using a ResNet model on a simple MNIST dataset to check models efficiency and power on simple dataset (gives 98% accuracy in a single epoch)
